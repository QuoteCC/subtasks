Current usability of SubTasks:
Tap on the text view of the "Add a task" to start text entry (text box is made visible and claims focus)
Once a task is made, a long click brings you back into editing, a short brings you to its subtask page

pressing the date button on the side opens the date picker
**HOLDING THIS BUTTON DELETES AN ENTRY***

The task bar shows the current task, or main in the case of top level

All updating of the db is AUTOMATIC, and doesn't require hitting a button to save (was a pain to implement)
